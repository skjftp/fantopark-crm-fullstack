# Bulk Payment Upload Feature Summary

## Overview
The bulk payment upload feature allows finance team members to upload multiple payment records at once using a CSV file. This feature streamlines the payment recording process and automatically creates orders for paid leads.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints
- **GET /api/bulk-payments/template** - Download CSV template with examples
- **POST /api/bulk-payments/upload** - Upload and process payment CSV
- **POST /api/bulk-payments/validate** - Validate CSV without processing
- **GET /api/bulk-payments/history** - View upload history
- **GET /api/bulk-payments/sample-data** - Get sample lead IDs for testing

### 2. CSV Format
The CSV supports the following fields:
- `lead_id` (required) - Unique identifier for the lead
- `lead_name`, `lead_email`, `lead_phone` - Customer details
- `event_name`, `event_date` - Event information
- `payment_date` (required) - Date of payment
- `payment_amount` (required) - Base payment amount
- `payment_mode` (required) - UPI, Bank Transfer, Credit Card, etc.
- `bank_name`, `transaction_id`, `cheque_number` - Payment details
- `invoice_numbers`, `invoice_amounts` - Multiple invoices supported (comma-separated)
- `taxes`, `discount`, `processing_fee` - Additional charges
- `total_amount` - Final amount paid
- `payment_status` - Full Payment or Partial Payment
- `payment_proof_url` - Link to payment proof
- `collected_by`, `branch`, `notes` - Additional information

### 3. Processing Logic
When a CSV is uploaded, the system:
1. Validates each row for required fields and data types
2. Verifies that lead IDs exist in the system
3. Creates payment records in `crm_payments` collection
4. Creates new orders or updates existing ones
5. Updates lead status to `payment_received`
6. Creates activity logs for audit trail
7. Tracks exchange differences for foreign currency payments

### 4. Frontend UI Features
The React component includes:
- **Drag & Drop Upload** - Easy file upload interface
- **Template Download** - Get pre-formatted CSV template
- **Validation** - Pre-validate CSV before processing
- **Upload History** - View past uploads and their status
- **Sample Data** - Get real lead IDs for testing
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time upload progress
- **Error Reporting** - Detailed error messages for failed records
- **Results Summary** - Success/failure counts and total amounts

### 5. Security & Permissions
